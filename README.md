# Game Design Document: The Fallen King
## 1.  Concept

The Fallen King is a strategic board game with a unique twist.  You play as the king, stripped of his usual powerful position and thrust into the role of protector.  The once-invulnerable king must now utilize the strengths of his fallen subjects to repel the enemy and save the kingdom.

## 2.  Gameplay

Board: The game takes place on a grid-based board with a designated starting point for the king and enemy pieces.
Pieces: The player controls the king and a rotating cast of fallen hero pieces. Each hero piece will have a unique movement pattern and special ability.
Objective: Defeat all enemy pieces before they reach the designated end point on the board.
Turn Structure:
Player Phase:
Player moves the king.
Player selects and moves a hero piece. The chosen hero piece can only be used once per level.
Player can utilize the hero's special ability once per turn (if applicable).
Enemy Phase:
Enemy pieces move according to pre-defined movement patterns.

## 3.  Hero Pieces

Each level will introduce a new fallen hero with a unique movement pattern and special ability.  Here are some potential examples:

* **Knight:**  Moves in an "L" shape pattern.  Special Ability: Can jump over other pieces (including enemies).
* **Archer:**  Moves diagonally.  Special Ability: Can attack enemies from a distance (potentially across multiple squares).
* **Mage:**  Moves a limited number of squares orthogonally (up/down/left/right).  Special Ability: Can cast area-of-effect spells to damage multiple enemies.
* **Healer:**  Moves a limited number of squares orthogonally.  Special Ability: Can heal the king or other hero pieces.

## 4.  Enemy Pieces

Enemy pieces will have varying movement speeds and attack capabilities.  They will follow pre-defined movement patterns to reach the end point of the board.  Defeating an enemy piece may grant the player resources or special effects.


## 5.  Progression

The game will feature multiple levels, each introducing a new hero piece and enemy type.
Levels should gradually increase in difficulty, requiring strategic use of different hero abilities.
Between levels, players may be able to unlock permanent upgrades for the king or future hero pieces.

## 6.  Art Style

The game can have a variety of potential art styles depending on the target audience.  Here are a few options:

Classic Chess Motif: A more traditional chess-like aesthetic with detailed pieces and board.
Fantasy Theme: A vibrant fantasy world with unique character designs for the heroes and enemies.
Minimalist: A clean and simple art style with a focus on clear piece differentiation and gameplay mechanics.

## 7.  Target Audience

The Fallen King can appeal to a broad audience of strategy game fans.  The chess-like core mechanics will be familiar to many players, while the unique twist on the king's role adds a fresh layer of strategy.  The difficulty progression can cater to both casual and hardcore strategy game enthusiasts.
